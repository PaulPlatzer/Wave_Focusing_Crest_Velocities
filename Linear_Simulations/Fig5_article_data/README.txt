Description:
  The files in this folder are the files that were actually used to plot the fifth 
  figure of the article 'Wave group focusing in the ocean: estimations using
  crest velocities and a Gaussian linear model'. You just need to comment/uncomment
  two lines in the '## Call all the files' subsection (around line 70) of the
  'Fig5_plot_k0Lf2.py', 'Fig5_plot_k0Lf5.py' and 'Fig5_plot_k0Lf10.py' python scripts.
